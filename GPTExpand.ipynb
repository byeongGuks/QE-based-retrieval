These early animals had no need for complex vision as their environment was relatively static with few predators or prey. Over time, these primitive organisms developed into larger creatures which required better visual capabilities so they could hunt down food sources at night when it became dark. This led them towards developing compound eyes - groups of many small lenses working together like a camera to provide a wider field-of-view (FOV).

Pencil as we know it today appeared around 1795 when English scientist William Strutt invented the process of manufacturing graphite from clay deposits found near his home town of Derby, England. He named this new substance \"plumbago\" after the mineral plumbum which means lead. Plumbago became popular because unlike other forms of graphite at the time (such as blacklead) its softness made it easy to carve into different shapes such as triangles, circles etc., making them ideal for drawing. However, due to concerns over health risks associated with ingesting large amounts of lead, manufacturers began replacing plumbago with non-toxic materials like clay, clay mixed with wax, and finally graphite itself starting in 1859when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils?\n",

            "Expanded_query_1 59 : Epidemiologists are scientists who study patterns of disease in populations, with the goal of identifying factors associated with increased risk for illness or death from specific diseases (called \"risk factors\"). Risk factor identification can help inform prevention strategies aimed at reducing overall rates of these illnesses among population groups. Epidemiologists also use their knowledge of risk factors to estimate how many people have a particular condition based on data collected through surveys or medical records; this information helps guide decisions regarding allocation of resources toward treatment and other measures designed to improve public health outcomes. In addition to studying individual-level risk factors like genetics or lifestyle choices, epidemiologists may investigate environmental exposures or social conditions which affect large numbers of individuals simultaneously—these types of risks are called \"population level\" risks because they impact entire communities rather than just one person individually. Some examples include air pollution levels measured near schools or factories where children might spend time during school hours each day versus homeschooled students living further away from industrial facilities etc., or whether there is adequate access to healthy food options within certain neighborhoods vs others without nearby grocery stores selling fresh produceepidemiologists attempt to explain the link between health and variables such as?\n",

            "Expanded_query_1 61 : Neural communication within and among neurons, or nerve cells, in the nervous system of animals takes place via chemical messengers called neurotransmitters which are released by one neuron at its synapse with another neuron. These transmitters bind to specific receptors on the surface of other nearby neurons causing them to fire action potentials (electrical impulses) thereby transmitting information from one cell to another across synapses.[1] This process was first demonstrated experimentally using electrical stimulation of frog nerves by Julius Bernstein in 1875,[2][3] but it wasn't until the early 20th century when scientists began studying the chemistry of brain activity that they learned how this transmission works chemically as well. In 1903, Santiago Ramon y Cajal described the release of \"substances\" during synaptic transmission[4] while in 1911, Otto Loewi showed that acetylcholine was the transmitter substance responsible for the effects observed after stimulating frog neuromuscular junctions; he also identified the receptor sites for these substances on muscle fibers.[5]who discovered that neural communication between cells occurs through chemicals?\n",

            "The history of Beijing dates back over 3,000 years and it used to have many different names throughout its development from a small village into one of China's largest cities today. In ancient times, this area around present-day Beijing was called Yanjing (烟井) or \"Smoke Pit\" because there were so many coal mines in the region which produced smoke when they were being mined. Later on during the Warring States Period (475–221 BC), after Qin Shi Huang united most of China under his rule, he renamed all the surrounding areas with Chinese characters meaning \"capital\". So for example, what we know now as Tiananmen Square was originally named Chang'an Jie (\"Capital City Gate\") since it marked the entrance to the capital city at the time. During the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-A.D 220), Emperor Wu changed the name again by adding another character 北 (běi) meaning north to make it Beidi (北京). This means North Capital but also refers to how it lies further north compared to other capitals such as Luoyang and Xian. It wasn't until 1912 that Peking became the official name of the city although some people still refer to it using either of these earlier names - e.g., you may hear someone say \"Let me tell you something about Beijing.\"what was the city of beijing previously known as?\n",
